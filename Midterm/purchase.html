            <h1>Are you interested in the Sims 4?</h1>
            
            <p>The Sims franchise are video games based on a real life simulation. You can be as creative or boring as you want. Create your own life and live it to the fullest... or not! It's your choice. There a bunch of options for things to do. Be a mermaid or a witch, raise a family, become a veterinarian or policeman. The opportunities are endless!</p>

            <p>To add a wide variety of content to your sims game, you must purchase some of the packs provided by EA. Some packs are larger than others with how much content they contain. Expansion packs are the largest, game packs are a bit smaller, stuff packs are smaller, and kits are estimated to have the same amount of contents as stuff packs.  </p>
