        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p>For Lab 1, I am going to be talking about my interest in PC gaming. I've always been a competitive person, but when a friend introduced me to computer games it began my journey. Video games helped guide me to my majors/focuses in college. I'm excited to see where it takes me in my career and life. </p>
        <p>Currently, my favorite game to play on my computer is Valorant. While a skillful game, I get lost in my thoughts while playing. It helps with stress relief too. </p>
